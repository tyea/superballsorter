				The objective of Super Ball Sorter is to sort balls into tubes by their colour.<br><br>
				At the start of a level the balls will be mixed up, move them one by one into different tubes. Tap on a tube to select its top ball, then tap on the tube you'd like to move it to. You can only move a ball into an empty tube or on top of another ball of the same colour. You cannot have more than four balls in a tube at once.<br><br>
				To complete the level each tube should have exactly four balls of the same colour. You may be left with one or more empty tubes as well!
